\section{Design Decisions}
We have chosen to use the MVC design pattern for our \CS application.

MVC separates our client into three parts, and makes it easy to switch one part with a replacement. This also makes it easy for us to wait with the visual part and focus on the backbone of our system.
Using MVC makes it easy to add more calendar formats, as long as the handling class meets the interface of our model.
